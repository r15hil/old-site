          <p>This project focused on the protection of forest elephants from poaching in the rainforest, forest elephants are also known as the 
            architects of the rainforest but if we do not start to protect them they will go extinct in the next 10 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of this work for Elephant Listening Project was to develop a detection system which allows for a more efficient and scalable tracking method 
            as well as a very high precision in gunshot detection. This will kickstart the development of a real-time detection system!
          </p>
          <p>
            Techniques and concepts being used to achieve this: software engineering, machine learning, computer vision, signal processing, cloud computing (using Microsoft Azure) 
            and feature engineering.

          <p>A clean and easy to use web app to analyse the different features of artists on Spotify. I chose to use Django as our web framework, Bootstrap as the CSS framework and Chart.js to display the data.</p>

         <p>I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project especially because front-end is something I have not done before, taking a minimalist approach in how I wanted the site to look and display data, so it is easy to for example compare two artists.</p>

          <p>AlcoLock is an IoT system. It blocks a laptop's access to a pre-set list of websites when the user is drunk i.e. a high level of alcohol in their breath. This is potentially useful to prevent irresponsible spending of money online, undesirable behaviour on social media/messaging platforms and other drunk people using someones laptop.</p>

        <p>It consists of a remote breathalyser which a user blows into at regular intervals. The breathalyser readings are sent to a desktop application on the laptop (over MQTT). This application then blocks sites based on the level of alcohol in the user's breath. The application GUI displays a user's alcohol level over time on a graph display.</p>
            It has a feature that allows a user to configure the sending of emails to people when very drunk. This allows the user to call in sick for work tomorrow at the click of a button.</p>

          <p> This project was part of my language processing course at university. Since we had to build the compiler from scratch it gave a great insight as to how a compiler really works.</p>

          <p>On our synthesiser we had many different settings that you could change such as different sound waves, sound effects, filtering and polyphony.</p>
          <p>Core skills learnt on this project were how to prevent deadlocks, running processes in parallel using threads and process priority as well as learning how to write C code efficiently for a micro-controller.</p>
